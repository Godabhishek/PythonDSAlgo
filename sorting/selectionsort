#T(n) = n + (n-1) + (n-2)+..+1 = n(n+1)/2 = O(n^2)
#in one scan of k steps, in a list of k elements, we can find minimum in that list
#similarly you need n scans of n elements to sort using selection sorting
#in python, anything upto 10^7 steps would take less than 1 second. more than this, you may consider the algorithm to be inefficient for that number of input.
#for eg: with selection sort, inputs upto list size of less than 1000 is ok. any size more than that, would take longer
#efficiency - n^2
#input of size - n^2
# 10 - 100
# 100 - 10^4
# 1000 - 10^6
# 10^4 - 10^8
# as you see this one is efficient until input size of 1000. For 10^4, steps required are in range of 10^8, which would be more than 1 second
# remember 10^7 ~ 1 sec in python
